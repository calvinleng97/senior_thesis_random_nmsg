Implementation of the algorithm that computes $h_{n, d_n - k}$ for sufficiently large $n$.

Details at https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00979. Proof of correctness given in senior thesis which
will be provided later.

Formulas for $h_{n, d_n - k}$ for sufficiently large $n$ and $k = 5, 6, 7$ given in the file
`qp_formulas.txt`.
